# How to Make a Good CV

**What is a CV?**

CV stands for curriculum vitae

You use it when you apply for jobs,for academic purposes, etc.




**What is The Difference Between a CV and a Resume?**

The difference between a CV and a resume lies in the length, layout, and purpose of these documents. Resumes are
shorter as they summarize skills and experience whereas CVs are more detailed and lengthier.

Nowadays there is almost no formal difference between a CV and a
resume.

**Sample CV Format**

➢ CV Header with Contact Information

➢ Personal Profile: CV Objective or CV Summary

➢ Work Experience

➢ Education

➢ Skills

➢ Additional Sections

➢ Referees

**Useful Tips**

1. Choose clear, legible fonts

➢ Go for one of the standard font types: Arial, Times New Roman, etc.

➢ For the author’s name and section titles, pick 14 to 16 pt font size.

2. Be consistent with your CV layout

➢Set one-inch margins for all four sides.

➢Make sure your CV headings are uniform—make them larger and in
bold but try to avoid italics and underlining

➢Stick to a single date format on your
CV

3. No unnecessary graphics

➢White space is important!

➢It is possible that after you send out your CV, it is going to be printed in black ink on white paper. Too many graphics might make
it illegible.

4. Photos?!

➢If they ask for a photograph, you need to have it. If not, it is not compulsory.

➢If you include a photo, make sure to use a professional looking picture, but not as stiff as an ID photo.

**Make Your CV Brief and Relevant**

➢Do not think that you have to include every single detail about
your life on your CV.

➢People do not have the time nor the interest to care for what high school you have attended or lengthy lists of past jobs, etc.

_Tip: Once you have finished writing, save your CV in the PDF
format to make sure your CV layout stays intact.
• But pay close attention to the job description._




**Adding Contact Information**

You want the recruiters to get back to you, so you need to let
them know how they can reach you.

**In the contact information section, enter your:**

➢Full name

➢Professional title

➢Email address

➢Telephone number

➢Social media contact information (optional)

➢Home address

**Start with a CV Personal Profile (CV Summary or CV Objective)**

➢ A CV personal profile statement—a brief paragraph of 100 words that gives an idea to the recruiters why you are just the candidate they have been looking for.

➢ Your personal profile will either be a CV objective or a CV summary.

➢ A CV objective shows what skills you have mastered and how you
would fit in. It is a good choice if you have got little work experience relevant to the job you are trying to land, for example, if you are writing a student CV.

➢ A CV summary, in turn, highlights your career progress and
achievements. Use it if you are a seasoned professional and have a
 lot of experience in your field.

**Relevant Work Experience & Key Achievements**

➢Your work experience section is the most important part of your
whole CV.

➢Recruiters not only want to know what you did but how well you
did it and what you can offer your prospective employer.

➢Focus on your measurable, relevant achievements, not just your
duties.

➢Use action verbs such as, “created,” “analyzed,” “implemented”.

➢Tailor your CV to suit the job requirements. Read the job
description carefully and check what tasks will be expected of
you

**CV Education Qualifications Section**
 
➢If you have a degree, include only that on your CV. Do not
mention your A/Ls, unless it is your highest degree of
education. List:

✓ Graduation year (if you are still studying, enter your expected
graduation date)

✓ Your degree

✓ Institution name

✓ Honors (if applicable

**Relevant Skills that Fit the Job Opening**

➢When you list your skills, add a short description of each to indicate your level of proficiency. For example “Excellent,” “Advanced,” or “Basic.”

**Include Additional CV Sections to Impress the Recruiter**

➢Sample CV Additional Sections 

✓ Industry awards 

✓ Professional certifications

✓ Publications

✓ Professional affiliations

✓ Conferences attended

✓ Additional training

**Referees**

➢Include contact information of at least two non related referees
related to the field you apply for.

➢Make sure that you inform the referees and get their consent to
include such information.
